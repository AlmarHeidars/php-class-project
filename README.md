# PHP Project: Todo List

In this PHP project we will incrementally create a *Todo List* application. This list starts as a basic command line output and ends as a dynamic web page which reads from a database.

It's broken into several parts which follow the Code Louisville curriculum. As you learn more about PHP in each session, you can apply what you've learned complete the next part.

## Getting Started

First, you'll want to clone this project. Feel free to create a *fork* of the project if you'd rather clone your own copy.

There are several [branches](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/branches) containing the completed code for each part. If it any point you fall behind, you can checkout the code from the previous part.

For example, to checkout the completed code from *Part 3*, you can run:

```bash
git checkout origin/part-3
```

If you have already checked out the branch and would like to *reset* your local changes back to the original version, you can run:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
git reset --hard origin/branch-name
```

## Parts
When you're ready to begin, review the *README* for each part.
