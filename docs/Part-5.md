# Part 5
In *Part 5*, we'll read the todo list items from a database table. You should keep your same code from before, but instead of using static todo items, use the data read from the database.


## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 4](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-4.md) or checkout the `part-5` branch.

## Going further
To take *Part 5* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- How could you add and display a *created* date for your todo items?
- Did you put your database code in a class? If not, try moving your database code to *TodoRepository* class with a method to `getTodoList()`.
- Which PHP database extension did you use? What's the difference between it and [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php)?
