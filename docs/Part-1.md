# Part 1

In *Part 1*, we'll create a simple PHP script to output a static *Todo List* with three items. The goal is to familiarize you with the command prompt, running a PHP script, and basic PHP syntax.

## Getting Started
To get started, checkout the `part-1` branch and create your script in the `src` folder.

## Going further
To take *Part 1* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- Try using `print` instead of `echo`. What's the difference?
- Try changing from single quotes to double quotes. How are they different?
- What is `PHP_EOL`? How is it different than `"\n"`?
