# Part 2

In *Part 2*, we'll expand on the code from *Part 1* by using additional PHP data structures, such as an array, as well as loops to output our *Todo List* more efficiently. In addition, we'll conditionally display some of the todo items as completed.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 1](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-1.md) or checkout the `part-2` branch.

## Going further
To take *Part 2* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- How could you adjust the conditional to mark the first and third items in the list as *completed*?
- Change your code to use a `while` loop, a `for` loop, and a `foreach` loop. Which best fits your code?
