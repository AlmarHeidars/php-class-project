# Part 4
In *Part 4*, we'll translate our procedural-style code and functions to object oriented code.

We'll create two object:
 
1. **TodoList** - this class should manage your todo items as well print the list output.
2. **TodoItem** - this class should store the information for a todo item, such as the *title*.

While these objects are simple, they'll demonstrate the reuse of code by grouping (encapsulating) your application logic into separate files.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 3](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-3.md) or checkout the `part-4` branch.

## Going further
To take *Part 4* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- Did you use a [constructor](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php)?
- What are the different [visibilities](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php)? Try changing some of yours. What happens?
- What is a `static` method? Can any of your methods be `static`?
- What other classes could you make related to the *Todo List*?
