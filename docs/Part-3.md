# Part 3

In *Part 3*, we'll introduce functions. Let's rewrite our *Todo List* to use two functions which:
 
1. output the *Todo List*
2. return a formatted todo item

## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 2](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-2.md) or checkout the `part-3` branch.

## Going further
To take *Part 3* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- Add an optional argument to your *format* function for *completed* which defaults to `false`.
- What are [type hints](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)? Can you use them in your functions?  
- What do you think about this code versus the previous code? Is it clearer?
- What other functions could you make?
- Do any of your custom functions already [exist in PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.internal.php)? How could you use a native function like `implode`?
