# Part 6
In *Part 6*, we'll move the application from the command line to a web page.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 5](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-5.md) or checkout the `part-6` branch.

While you are welcome to create your own template, you can also copy the `web` folder from `part-6` branch.

If your PHP version supports the built in web server, you run your PHP project with:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1 -t web
```

## Going further
To take *Part 6* a bit further, consider making the following changes on your own:

- How would you update the form to allow adding a todo item?
- What about marking items as completed?
- How could you avoid refreshing the page?
