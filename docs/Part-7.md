# Part 7
In *Part 7*, we'll introduce Composer to the project. This will allow use autoloading - so we can namespace our project - as well as other PHP libraries from the community.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can update the code you created in [Part 6](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/php-class-project/tree/master/docs/Part-6.md) or checkout the `part-6` branch.
